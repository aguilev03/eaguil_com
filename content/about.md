## Hey there! 
I'm Evan, a tech enthusiast and lifelong learner who's always curious about how things work. By day, I dive deep into IT and business, but outside of that, I'm constantly exploring new hobbies and interests. Whether tinkering with the latest tech, finding new ways to streamline my workflows, or getting lost in a good philosophy book, I love pushing my boundaries and learning something new.

When I'm not busy with tech or studies, I'm usually indulging in one of my many hobbies, whether it's playing video games, practicing a bit of programming, or working on self-improvement. I also spend quality time with my wife and dog, Oli, who's always there to keep things interesting.

This space is where I share my thoughts, projects, and experiences. Feel free to look around and join me on this journey of exploration!
